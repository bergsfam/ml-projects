Which model has the best test F1 score and time efficiency? Which model is generally the most appropriate based on the available data, limited resources, cost, and performance? Please directly compare and contrast the numerical values recored to make your case.\n",

    "*Based on the experiments performed above with four different models, I recommend the Support Vector Machine Model (SVM).  Looking at the tables above, one can see that both SVM and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) performed best on the test set.  When considering the each of the training and prediction times, KNN performs about the same as SVM.  However, due to its nature, KNN requires significantly more prediction time than training time.  Having run the model several times, it looks to me as though the SVM training time for 300 datapoints is a bit of an anomaly of the run itself and should not be construed to generalize the time it will take the model.  (Results are kept as is to match the iPythin Notebook.*  \n",

    "*This model will be used more often for predicting how students will perform and thus prediction time will be more important than training time.  Additionally, SVM was able to get the best result using the least amount of data (100 points).  This will aid us in when we have limited ability to gather data.*\n",

    "*Our goal with this model is to correctly classify those students that will graduate vs. not graduate.  So we want the model to divide each of the students into one of two groups.  Support Vector Machines (SVM) work by finding the dividing line between the students into those two groups.  In training the SVM the algorithm finds the \"support vectors\" - or lines at the edge of each of the two groups.  (See Lines A & B below).  It chooses the best line - where best is the line that has the most margin (or space) between the two groups. (See Line C below)*\n",
